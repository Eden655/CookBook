              <text value="On this page, you are able to search for the recipes that you have already put in.  If you wish to find a recipe by the variables it has, checks the boxes by the column that you would most want. If you want to find a recipe with the least amount of time, then you check the 'time' variable, which will bring up all the recipes in order of how long they take to make, from shortest to longest time. If you want to find a recipe with the most likability, then you check the 'likability' variable, which will bring up all the recipes in order of their likability rating, order of highest to lowest.  If you want to find a recipe that is the least difficult to make, then you check the 'difficulty' variable, which will bring up all the recipes in order of how difficult they are to make, from easiest to hardest. If you want to sort the recipes by ingredients, select the type of ingredients that you would like them to have, it can be more than one, and it will list the recipes with all those types of ingredients and more. You could also search it up by name on the 'search by name' bar. Just enter the name of the recipe, and it will look for the recipe with the same name. Once you have finished typing the name or checking the variables, press the 'search' button to reload the recipe list. "/>
